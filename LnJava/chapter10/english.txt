After passing the 2014 College Examinating, I am happy to go to China University of Mining & Technology, so that I will make full use of my campus life and learn to plan it.
Firstly, I am an adult of 18 years old, so I should learn to be independent. As I am away from my parents, it is necessary for me to learn to live on my own, such as doing some washing and cleaning by myself. 
Secondly, as a student, I will give priority to the development of my knowledge and skills, so I am determined to spend most of my spare time studying hard. Besides, I will learn how to think of the questions critically and study my course creatively.
Finally, I will get used to society with active attitude, creating my own value of life. On the one hand, I will participate in some associations to learn something outside textbooks and get some understandings about society and the world. 
Whst's more, I want to read many valuable books in the library. On the other hand, I will make more friends on campus. It is an effective way to improve my communicative abilities and confidence.
In conclusion, I do believe that my college life will turn out to be colorful and fruitful.
