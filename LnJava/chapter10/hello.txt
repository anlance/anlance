University, a magnificent word, which makes me have much imagination.
People have a name for it, which is the “irony tower”, it's a good place to live and study. 
In the ivory tower, romantic love just like cherry blossom smiles happily in the campus.  
Many girls have the pleasing dream that one day there is a boy who stands below the windows loudly announcing "I love you", 
holding a bound of flowers in his hands.  
But the most important thing is that I can receive the advanced education systematically, 
listen to the senior professors’ experience. I can also attend numerous courses of lectures. 
To my pleasant, I can be free to spend a whole day in the library and read every book that I'd like, 
which makes me find the knowledge is limitless considerably. All these let me climb up in the field of science. 
At the same time, the people from various parts of the Motherland get together. 
It's a good opportunity for me to make a lot of friends.   I can find a part-time job to experience the life, 
which is a good way of contacting society. In a word, 
there're many things waiting for me to learn, and this is why I come here to be a university student.
