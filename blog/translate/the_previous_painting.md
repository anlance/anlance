The afflatus would turns into poetry and painting
The man would turns into cowardly and complicated
All of a moment, the man never to be seen again there, but the poetry and the paintings  still are

### original————the man who count star

The two pictures below were drawn on my self-study class in MianYang. There is a long interval between completing the two paintings, which respresented the diffferent moods of the time. Now I had only scattered memories about that.

#### abyss

This painting can be viewed from diffferent angles, in different order.with obvious dividing lines in the middle, but each part has a part that connects with the other parts.

#### tempt moon

This painting is totally don't remember; maybe beacause I have heared the `Mars guard heart` idiom before, then this painting was born.
